# SUP-NVSE-PLUGIN

NVSE plugin which adds new functions and allows modders to easily add new UI elements to the game (HUD Bars).

Avaiable here::https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/73160

Latest source code can be found in SUP-NVSE-PLUGIN-V310.rar. After Windows reinstallation I can't find a way to update current branch.
